tf_aerial_images.py trains a CNN model. To get the submission file `submission.csv` for the prediction made by the CNN model 
```
python tf_aerial_images.py
python mask_to_submission.py
```
The folder `predictions_test` contains the predictions made by the CNN model on the test data. `Predictions_training` has the 
predictions made by the model on the training data.

`segment_aerial_images.ipynb` trains a linear classifier. Probably won't be useful.
